## Specifications

> Normal state

We use these Items when the user can choose more than one option before validating a choice.
These components can also be used when there's a secondary question on a flow step that's doesn't require it's own step (ex. Terms and conditions). These cases should be exceptions though.

> Long texts

There is no limitation on the number of lines. When the text is long, icons and checkboxes are centred in height.
