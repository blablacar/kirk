# Secondary Button

<!-- STORY -->

## Specifications

These buttons can be used as a secondary option when there’s already a primary button action.

When user taps on it there’s a pressed state.
After tapping if request is already loaded we either go to the next page or close the modal or if it’s a final decision we display the checked state then close the page (in some cases we don’t change the page like create alert in Search Results).
If request is not loaded we display the loading state of these buttons. When loaded, we either go to the next page or close the modal or if it’s a final decision we display the checked state.

```js
<Button status={ButtonStatus.SECONDARY}>content</Button>
```

## When should I use it?

- ✅ Always centred in the page
- ⛔️ Can’t go on 2 lines. If too long we use “…”
- ⛔️ Not always sticky
- ℹ️ No minimum size.

## Behaviour

These buttons are always displayed on the bottom right of the screen. They can either be sticky or not depending on the need.

If sticky they appear above the keyboard and above other components in the page.

When there’s an error that blocks the user to move forward, we hide these buttons.

## Long texts

If text is too long we can’t go on 2 lines. If too long we display “…” at the end.
