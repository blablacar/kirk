## Specifications

We use these items when the user wants to modify a previously selected value. You can't select several choices.

They appear in subflows.

They can't be used as a pre-selected option in a one-screen one-action flow.

There is no limitation on the number of lines for the main info or title. The text, icons and checkboxes are centered in height.
