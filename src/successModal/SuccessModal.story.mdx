## Specifications

### Normal state

There’s always an illustration at the top of the screen (on the left on `large` screen).
This illustration could be animated.
There’s a centred white the voice and always a generic button.

### Navigate

There’s no top bar in a success screen so user can’t go back. If the user is using the browser back we redirect him to the right page depending on the case.

### Animation

No animation specs yet but for now let’s make it appear with a fade in and disappear with a fade out.

### Layout

This modal is always being displayed in fullscren. Use `size` prop to change the layout depending on the screen size.

## Usage

```jsx
import { SuccessModal } from '@blablacar/ui-library/build/successModal'
export const ModalWithButton = () => {
  const [isOpened, setOpened] = useState(false)
  return (
    <BaseSection>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setOpened(true)
        }}
      >
        Open SuccessModal
      </button>
      <SuccessModal
